== Overview

Carbon provides a series of features to a Groovy script by using a declarative style and some conventions.

=== Motivation

After writing a certain amount of Groovy scripts, I've found out that:

- *There's no time to document scripts*, not even for usage hint
- Many of them are *repeating code*, specially when handling the configuration
- They *lack common logging* configuration
- *Ansi output* sometimes is necessary to make scripts friendlier
- Scripts connecting *databases* could be even shorter
- *Certain conventions* would help to create and maintain scripts

Even with the Groovy CLI builder I saw myself repeating a lot of code, and that's why I started thinking
on creating Carbon.

=== Picocli FTW

Nothing of what Carbon is would be possible without the use of the amazing https://picocli.info/[Picocli] library.
And of course if you're trying to create scripts with any language of the JVM I'd strongly
recommend you to give it a try.
